# RastaRocket 1.0.1

## Bug fixes
- Fixed a bug in `freq_relevel()` where the *group* variable was unintentionally releveled. This behavior could alter group ordering in summary tables and cause issues when stacking multiple variables.

## Improvements
- Refactored `modify_ajouter_label_dm()` with cleaner and more elegant internal code.

## Documentation
- Updated the README file.
